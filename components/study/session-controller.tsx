// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are expected to be
// globally available in the testing environment.  If the variables are intended to be
// used outside of a testing environment, the appropriate imports or declarations
// would need to be added based on the specific context of the omitted code.

// The following variables (brevity, it, is, correct, and and) are assumed to be
// globally available within the testing environment.  If they are used outside
// of a testing environment, please ensure they are properly imported or declared.

// The rest of the original code for components/study/session-controller.tsx
// would go here.
