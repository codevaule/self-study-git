// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// I will add a comment indicating that these variables are expected to be globally
// available in the testing environment.  If they are intended to be imported,
// the appropriate import statements would need to be added based on the specific
// testing framework being used.

// Assuming 'describe', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' are part of a testing framework
// like Jest or Mocha, they are expected to be globally available.
// If they are not globally available, you will need to import them:
// For example (Jest):
// import { describe, it, expect } from '@jest/globals';

// The 'brevity' variable is also assumed to be part of the testing framework or
// a utility library used for testing. If it's a custom function, it needs to be defined.
// If it's from a library, it needs to be imported.
// For example (if brevity is a custom function):
// function brevity(input: any): any { /* implementation */ }

// Or (if brevity is from a library, e.g., lodash):
// import { brevity } from 'lodash';

// The rest of the original code would follow here.  Since the original code is not provided,
// I cannot integrate the fixes directly into the original file.  This response provides
// the necessary context and instructions for how to resolve the undeclared variable issues.
